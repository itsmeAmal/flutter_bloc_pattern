# Flutter BLoC Pattern Sample Project

This is a sample Flutter project that illustrates the implementation of the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern. The project showcases how to effectively use events, states, and the BLoC class in conjunction with the BLoC Builder and BLoC Provider.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. If not, you can follow the installation instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsmeAmal/flutter_bloc_pattern.git

```

### Run the Project

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch the Flutter application on your device or emulator.

## Overview

### BLoC Pattern

The BLoC pattern is a state management approach in Flutter that separates the business logic from the UI layer. This project demonstrates how to organize your code using BLoC to handle events and manage states in a clean and scalable manner.

### Project Structure

- **`lib/features/counter_event.dart`**: Defines events related to the counter feature.
- **`lib/features/counter_state.dart`**: Represents the states for the counter feature.
- **`lib/counter_block.dart`**: Implements the `CounterBlock` class, which extends the BLoC class and initializes with an initial state.
- **`lib/main.dart`**: Contains the main application code, where the BLoC Provider and BLoC Builder are used.
